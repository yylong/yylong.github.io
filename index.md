excerpt: "About Me..."

I am currently an assistant professor in the [ School of Mechatronics Engineering](http://lxy.gzmu.edu.cn "  School of Mechatronics Engineering") at [Guizhou Minzu University](http://www.gzmu.edu.cn "Guizhou Mingzu University"), and working in the Intelligent Unmanned System Perception and Control Research Group.

My research interests are in the areas of modeling, control, and planning algorithms. I am particularly interested in developing advanced modeling and control techniques in the air vehicles that make air vehicles to complete tasks under strict conditions. Besides, I am interested in the precise state estimation of air vehicles with general and advanced sensors.

Currently, I am focused on modeling and control methods for multi-body under-actuated flight vehicle systems. Previous works always describe the multi-body system with local-coordinates and design controllers in the local chart. Our strategies provide a much more compact and more straightforward general formulation to describe the multi-body system globally. A guidance and control method with the system's intrinsic properties is provided based on the intrinsic modeling method.
